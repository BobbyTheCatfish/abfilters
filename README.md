Easily create useful lists to find people who would normally go under the radar!

Some examples are:
- Member households with one person
- Duplicate addresses
- Optimal LSI families
- Households with no parents
- And anything else you can imagine

With a robust and easy to use filter creation tool, you can get as simple or complicated as you want!

# PRIVACY & YOU

The information that is obtained from the church database via the provided link, as well as any others you may find, contains sensitive personal information. As such, the way you store and share this information is very important. This data shall not be stored or shared on any platform (yes that includes Google Sheets). Instead, create a group inside the Preach My Gospel App and manually add the people to that.

# PRIVACY & ME

As someone who realizes just how much information has to be copied over to this site, I realize just how important it is to keep it secure. That's why this site doesn't store anything, not even cookies. The only network requests this site makes are for the site layout/styling, and Google Analytics. Google Analytics does not see the input lists, filters, output lists, or anything inbetween. All it records are scrolling, outbound clicks, file downloads, and number of interactions with forms. All of this data is nUmBeRs (haha missionary joke), no other data is sent. If you want to fact check this, please be my guest and inspect the code in this repository.
